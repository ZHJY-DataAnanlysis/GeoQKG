# GeoQKG
GeoQKG is the pre-training-free representation method that comprehensively extracts the relational information among key elements of a question and stores it in a knowledge structure. This repository provides the code for reproducing GeoQKG method, which is proposed in our paper "**knowledge-structure chimera: towards pre-training-free representation for multimodal geometry question**" 

For the code of the method, please refer to [GeoQKG](https://github.com/ZHJY-DataAnanlysis/GeoQKG).

The Geometry3K  dataset is now available on [Geometry3K](https://lupantech.github.io/inter-gps/).

The GeoQA dataset is now available on [GeoQA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fiLTJUq7EPiZHs6AxundNfNEDLw4gtP5).

## Construct question knowledge graph
To construct a comprehensive question knowledge graph, please follow the steps below:
1. Enter the 'code' directory
    ```bash
    cd code
    ```
2. Prepare for the mimic_all.csv (MIMIC-CXR-JPG needs to be ready)
    ```bash
    python get_mimic_all.py -p <path_to_mimic_cxr_jpg>
    ```
3. Extract the intermediate KeyInfo json dataset. The <path_to_reports_folder> refers to the "files" folder that is unzipped from the mimic-cxr-reports.zip file in the MIMIC-CXR database.
    ```bash
    python question_gen.py -j -r <path_to_reports_folder>
    ```
4. Generate the full version of question answer pairs
    ```bash
    python question_gen.py -q
    ```

    Alternatively, you can execute step 3 and step 4 simultaneously by running:
    ```bash
    python question_gen.py -j -q
    ```
## Design adaptive tasks
To adapt question representations utilizing knowledge graphs, we devised four independent downstream tasks: similarity prediction, difficulty evaluation, image-text retrieval, and geometric question answering.
1. Question similarity task:
    Enter the 'Similar' directory
   ```bash
    cd Similar
    ```
3. Question difficulty task:
    Enter the 'Difficult' directory
    ```bash
    cd Difficult
    ```
5. Image-text retrieval:
    Enter the 'Image and text retrieval' directory
   ```bash
    cd Image and text retrieval
    ```
7. Geometric question answeringï¼š
    Enter the 'GeoQAnswer' directory
    ```bash
    cd GeoQAnswer
    ```
